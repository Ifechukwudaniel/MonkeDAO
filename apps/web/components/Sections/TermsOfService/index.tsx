            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              MonkeDeals is a decentralized, user-owned platform that transforms
              real-world discounts and promotions into collectible, tradable
              NFTs. These NFTs (“Deals”) may grant holders access to discounts,
              offers, or experiences provided by participating merchants.
            </p>
          </div>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding
              contract to use MonkeDeals. By using our Services, you confirm
              that you meet these requirements.

              3. Wallets & Authentication
            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              MonkeDeals uses wallet-based authentication through{' '}
              <strong>Reown</strong>. When you connect your wallet, you
              authenticate your identity via your blockchain address. We do not
              store your private keys or seed phrases — you are solely
              responsible for safeguarding your wallet.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mt-3">
              Any transaction you make on-chain (minting, buying, trading, or
              redeeming deals) is recorded on a public blockchain and cannot be
              reversed.

              <li>
                Merchants may create and list promotional NFTs (“Deals”) on the
                MonkeDeals platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                Merchants are solely responsible for the accuracy, fulfillment,
                and validity of the deals they publish.
              </li>
              <li>
                MonkeDeals acts only as a discovery and facilitation platform
                and is not liable for the performance or redemption of any
                merchant offers.

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              When you purchase or claim a Deal NFT, you own the digital token
              itself. Ownership of the NFT does not grant you intellectual
              property rights over MonkeDeals’ brand or underlying merchant
              content unless explicitly stated by the merchant.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mt-3">
              NFTs may be transferable and tradable on supported marketplaces.
              However, any real-world benefits tied to a Deal are subject to the
              terms and expiration set by the issuing merchant.

              Transactions on MonkeDeals may involve gas fees or service fees
              depending on blockchain network conditions. Payments are processed
              via third-party providers such as <strong>Helius</strong> or{' '}
              <strong>Solana Pay</strong>. MonkeDeals does not store or handle
              user funds directly.
